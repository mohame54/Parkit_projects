## Here we have 2 models for machine learning, the first is used to identify vehicles, and we will use it to identify empty lane numbers so that the user can know them before reaching the parking lot, and another model to identify the carâ€™s number plate, and its task is to control entry and exit from parking by the user when it is booked He enters his car number, and upon arrival at the parking lot, the car numbers are recognized and matched in the data base, and the gate opens, and upon exit, the same process occurs
